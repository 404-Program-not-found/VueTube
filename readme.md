- A fully customizable UI
- Most features from the official youtube app
- Google account sign in
- Tracking protection
- Advanced video search

### Why am I doing this?
Well this has been thrown around on the Return Youtube Dislike discord server for quite some time, so I figured that I should probably take a crack at it!
